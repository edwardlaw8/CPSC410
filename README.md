==============

We are going to be analyzing the date that changes to packages were committed by looking at the Github commit history (using Custom-github-analyzer), the degree of coupling of each package (using JDepend), and the code quality of each package (using PMD). We will be analyzing 1) whether packages that are created earlier have more problems with code quality, and 2) whether coupling of packages is associated with code quality (i.e. whether loose coupling of packages is associated with less problems in the code). We will produce an animated real-time visualization of each class for the source repositories Sponge and twoway-View. The visualization will display the number of violations of code quality for each class, the coupling between packages, and the date when each class or package was created.
